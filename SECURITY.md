# Security Policy

## Reporting Vulnerabilities

**DO NOT** open public issues for security vulnerabilities.

Email the maintainer directly (check GitHub profile) with:
- Description and steps to reproduce
- Potential impact

## Security Best Practices

- Use ESPHome API encryption and OTA passwords
- Keep devices on trusted networks (WPA2/WPA3)
- Test thoroughly - this controls heating systems
- Monitor for updates
